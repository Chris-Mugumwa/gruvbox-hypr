# Monitor wiki https://wiki.hyprland.org/0.45.0/Configuring/Monitors/

# Ultrawide monitor configuration (3440x1440 @ 165Hz)
# Note: 34" at 3440x1440 = ~109 PPI (same as 27" at 2560x1440)
# This means UI elements will appear the same physical size as on a 27" 1440p monitor
#
# Scale options:
#   1.0  = Native (no scaling) - recommended for most users
#   1.25 = Makes UI 20% smaller (more screen space, sharper text)
#   1.5  = Makes UI 33% smaller (maximum screen space)
monitor = ,3440x1440@165,0x0,1

# If you want UI elements smaller (more screen space), try:
# monitor = ,3440x1440@165,0x0,1.25

# Alternative: Auto-detect everything (fallback if above doesn't work)
# monitor = , preferred, auto, 1


# If you need to scale things like steam etc, please uncomment these lines.
# Adjust GDK_SCALE accordingly to your liking.
#xwayland {
#  force_zero_scaling = true       # Unscale XWayland

#env = GDK_SCALE, 1.25                   # GDK Scaling Factor

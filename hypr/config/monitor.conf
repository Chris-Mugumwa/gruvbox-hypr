# Monitor wiki https://wiki.hyprland.org/0.45.0/Configuring/Monitors/

# Ultrawide monitor configuration (3440x1440 @ 165Hz)
# Note: 34" at 3440x1440 = ~109 PPI (same as 27" at 2560x1440)
# This means UI elements will appear the same physical size as on a 27" 1440p monitor
#
# IMPORTANT: Hyprland fractional scaling support varies by system!
# Safe scaling values that work on ALL systems:
#   1.0  = Native (no scaling) - SAFE DEFAULT, always works
#   1.25 = Fractional scaling - Works on most systems
#   1.5  = Higher fractional - Works on most systems
#   2.0  = Integer scaling - Always works
#
# WARNING: Values like 1.15, 1.20 may cause "invalid scale" errors!
# Only use if you've tested them first (see instructions below)
#
# Using SAFE default (1.0) - UI is sized correctly, just reduce app font sizes instead
monitor = ,3440x1440@165,0x0,1.0

# If UI still feels too large, try 1.25 (most compatible fractional scale):
# monitor = ,3440x1440@165,0x0,1.25

# To test if a custom scale works on your system:
# 1. Start Hyprland with default 1.0
# 2. Open terminal and run: hyprctl keyword monitor ,3440x1440@165,0x0,1.2
# 3. If no error appears and display looks good, you can use that scale here
# 4. If you see "invalid scale" error, stick with 1.0 or 1.25

# Alternative: Auto-detect everything (fallback if above doesn't work)
# monitor = , preferred, auto, 1


# If you need to scale things like steam etc, please uncomment these lines.
# Adjust GDK_SCALE accordingly to your liking.
#xwayland {
#  force_zero_scaling = true       # Unscale XWayland
#}

#env = GDK_SCALE, 1.25                   # GDK Scaling Factor

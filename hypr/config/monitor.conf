# Monitor wiki https://wiki.hyprland.org/0.45.0/Configuring/Monitors/

# Ultrawide monitor configuration (3440x1440 @ 165Hz)
# Note: 34" at 3440x1440 = ~109 PPI (same as 27" at 2560x1440)
# This means UI elements will appear the same physical size as on a 27" 1440p monitor
#
# Scale options for 34" ultrawide:
#   1.0  = Native (no scaling) - Good if you like larger UI
#   1.15 = Makes UI ~13% smaller - RECOMMENDED for most users
#   1.20 = Makes UI ~17% smaller - Sweet spot for productivity
#   1.25 = Makes UI ~20% smaller - Maximum usable space
#
# Start with 1.15 or 1.20 for best balance on ultrawide
monitor = ,3440x1440@165,0x0,1.15

# Alternative: If things still feel too large, try 1.20:
# monitor = ,3440x1440@165,0x0,1.20

# If you prefer larger UI (original config):
# monitor = ,3440x1440@165,0x0,1

# Alternative: Auto-detect everything (fallback if above doesn't work)
# monitor = , preferred, auto, 1


# If you need to scale things like steam etc, please uncomment these lines.
# Adjust GDK_SCALE accordingly to your liking.
